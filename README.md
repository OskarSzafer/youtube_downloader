## required custom python libraries:
- PyTube
- MoviePy

To run the application, download the required libraries and run the "main.py" file. <br>
The GUI allows you to choose a movie, specify the desired fragment, and change the quality. <br>
Leaving the "start time" and "end time" boxes empty will default to the beginning and end of the movie as the time interval.
